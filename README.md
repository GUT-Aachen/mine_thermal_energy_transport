# mine_thermal_energy_transport
Evaluate techno-economic feasibility of shallow geothermal energy transport, see XXXXX

## Requirements
### Overall 
 - Python 3.10 (code has not been tested with other Python versions).
 - Python package dependencies:
 -   Numpy
 -   Pandas
 -   Scipy
 -   Matplotlib
 -   Optional: [TSAM](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam) for time series aggregation.
 
### Model Execution
 - Python package dependencies:
   - [COMANDO](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/iek-10/public/optimization/comando) and its dependencies (Optimisation framework).
   - [Psweep](https://github.com/elcorto/psweep/tree/0.9.0) 0.10.0 or lower (Parametric analysis and housekeeping).
 - [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/) 10.0 or higher

## Setup
 - Check for Python version and package dependencies (virtual environment or separated Conda environment is recommended)
 - SETUP GUROBI solver installation, further details can be found in the COMANDO [readthedocs](https://comando.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces.html#interfaces)

## Required Inputs

- Thermal load time series. The original study considered time series for single-family houses generated using [RC_BuildingSimulator](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/RC_BuildingSimulator)
- Ambient temperature time series. The original study used TMY data from [PV-GIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/)
- Ground temperature time series (for pipe losses calculation). The original study derived the ground temperature from the ambient temperature, as indicated in the manuscript.
- Horizon of analysis and interest rate (n = 30 years and i = 0.03 by default).
- Cost of components and commodities. Source of the included data detailed in the manuscript's main body and supplementary information.

## Usage
### Base_Code
The code includes a sample case for a decentralised thermal system, considering the Rheinish Coal Mining Area (Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier), NRW, Germany region conditions and a non-insulated PE transmission pipeline. The code is executed by running the study.py file. All the required inputs and functions are in the _data and _script folders. Results will be stored in a newly generated _results folder.

Further component examples are found in the [COMANDO](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/iek-10/public/optimization/comando) list of examples.

### Results - Manuscript Data and Figure Generation
The data generated by the models is found in the 'Results' folder for each case of analysis (Decentralised and Centralised), in .csv and .pk (python pickle) format, the file name indicates the region (VIC or NRW) and whether the transmission pipes are insulated or not (S3 or NoIns).

## Considerations
- COMANDO is solver agnostic; minor modifications to the code should be needed to run the code with other solvers, although the authors haven't tested this so far. Part of the code used for post-processing relies on GUROBI outputs, which would need to be adjusted as well.
The individual heat pumps/RCAC components are reversible. If time aggregation is used, be careful with simultaneous heating and cooling demand, as this will result in an unfeasible model.
- The study file is set up to run using Python multiprocessing capabilities. If this isn't desired, the code must be changed accordingly.
